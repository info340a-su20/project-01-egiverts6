    <h1>Mental Heath in Light of a Global Pandemic</h1>

    <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
    <h4>Overview:</h4>
    <p>
        Mental health is an incredibly important topic that has become more accepted and talked about in recent years. 
        However, it still remains a traditionally “taboo” topic in our modern society. “Mental health includes our emotional, 
        psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, 
        relate to others, and make healthy choices.” It is important to note that poor mental health and mental illness are 
        different. However, In 2017, there were an “estimated 46.6 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with 
        AMI. This number represented 18.9% of all U.S. adults.” According to the <a href="https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/2019/02/5-surprising-mental-health-statistics/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20almost,equivalent%20to%2043.8%20million%20people.">Mental Health USA Blog</a>, 
        “In the United States, only 41 percent of the people who had a mental disorder in the past year received professional 
        health care or other services.” The real problems lie in the individual’s awareness of their own mental illness, the tabooness of 
        getting help, and having accessible/affordable resources to get help. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, billions of people 
        were forced to quarantine themselves for months. The effects of the virus fears as well as long term isolation has greatly 
        affected mental health of people all over the world like never before. According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/">Washington Post</a>, 
        “A federal emergency hotline for people in emotional distress registered a more than 1,000 percent increase in April 
        compared with the same time last year.”

    <h4>Information Technology Problem:</h4>
    <p>
        The problem this project will focus on is the difficulty in acknowledging and identifying mental illness and poor mental 
        health, specifically targeting this difficult pandemic-centered time period. creating an information resource to both 
        represent an information resource to identify mental illness and help resolve those issues, as well as provide easily 
        accessible, affordable, and discreet outside resources. 
    </p>
    <h4>Attempts to Solve The Problem:</h4>
    <p>
        At the moment there are limited online solutions available to solve this problem. Specifically, there has been no effort 
        made to solve the problem in regards to COVID-19 conditions. Traditionally, therapy or prescribed medicine is an option 
        for those who identify their mental health issues and most often have the insurance and/or other financial resources to 
        cover the costs. Many online therapy programs exist such as Talkspace, BetterHelp, Regain, Teen Counseling, etc. However, 
        these online resources are often costly while offering mediocre services; these resources also notably don’t cater to 
        those who struggle with severe mental illnesses. 
    </p>



    <h2>Proposed Application:</h2>
    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
        As previously explained, applications will prioritize multiple topics. The first being an information resource in itself. 
        This information resource will first consist of an in depth survey as well as an optional phone call with a mental health 
        professional in order to identify which mental illness/ mental health issue exists if any. It will then include some type 
        of information resource, focusing on solutions that can be achieved remotely. In light of the pandemic, all solutions and 
        resources will be targeted remotely in order to provide maximum accessibility and ease of use. The second part of the 
        application will consist of a library of reliable, affordable, and accessible remote resources. The third part of the a
        pplication will include an anonymous reddit-style forum where users can discuss their mutual issues with mental health. 
        This will enable users to relate their struggles with others in an anonymous, safe space. 
    </p>
    <h4>Users:</h4>
    <p>
        Users will include those experiencing mental health issues as well as those struggling with mental illnesses such as 
        depression, anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, etc. Users may also include those who are confused with their mental state 
        and need clarity in knowing if they should get help or not.
    </p>
    <h4>Possible Elements/Interctions:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Survey to identify poor mental health and/or mental illness</li>
        <li>24/7 online message system with mental health professional</li>
        <li>Online resource itself</li>
        <li>Anonymous forum</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How Using This App Will Help:</h4>
    <p>
        Although remote resources already exist for those struggling with mental health issues, they come with many issues and are 
        often extremely costly if used long-term. Another major issue is that although these resources do exist, including free 
        information and programs, the information they offer is often scattered in different areas. Information can be extremely 
        difficult to take in and effectively solve the issue simply due to the overwhelmingness of the scope of the internet. The 
        main goal of this application is to provide reliable, affordable, and accessible information and resources all in one place. 
        Although it is most likely impossible to eliminate all mental illness with a single app (especially since many require the 
        combination of therapy and medication), this will hopefully help people on a large scope in a safe and non-threatening manner. 
        With so many people developing new mental health issues in regards to the CoronaVirus pandemic, addressing and combatting 
        these growing issues are extremely important.
